# Personal Dotfiles

This are my configuration files. Should work on _*nix_ systems although are created in Linux Mint 19(Ubuntu 18.04).

This work is based on other dotfiles:

- [Tute](https://github.com/tute/dotfiles)
- [Pedro Fernandez](https://github.com/pedrofernandezm/dotfiles)
- [Web Pro](https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles)

and this getting started guide: [Getting Started with Dotfiles](https://medium.com/@webprolific/getting-started-with-dotfiles-43c3602fd789).

## Installation

Clone this repo

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/cesc1989/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
```

Symlink files to $HOME folder

```bash
$ 
```
